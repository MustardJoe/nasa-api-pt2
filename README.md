<h1>Welcome to AstroView</h1>
</center>

**General Info:** I love astronomy, and since I was a child I've found astronomy pictures 
inspiring food for my sense of wonder and imagination. Since the mid '90s Nasa has been
publishing an Astronomy Picture of the Day (occasionaly refered to as APOD). I created 
AstroView as a way to display data from the Nasa Astronomy Picture of the day. Please
feel free to use AstroView to inspire you as you browse through the decades of photos
and information!

**Technical Info:** AstroView is a React SPA built as a front-end to interface with the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day REST Api. AstroView makes use of the Moment.js library to help parse dates.
