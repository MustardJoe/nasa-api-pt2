I am making a second atempt at a project I have wanted to do for a while: a user interface for the NASA api.  will start with just pulling up a Nasa photo of the day from a day the user provides, will add on later functionality as interests inspire.

will have user supply their own key, and then they will be able to navigate through the api in a more "useable" format than just making a series of long querry strings in the browser url bar.

also want this version to be react-based.
