        Welcome to AtroView! I love astronomy and
        outer space, and so I created a user-friendly way to browse through the

        Upon initial view, AstroView loads with Astronomy Picture Of the Day (APOD) for today. Enter any date
        in the adjoining box to view other APODs. (Note: no data
        exists before 1995-6-20.)
